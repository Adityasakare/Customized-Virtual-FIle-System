# Customized-Virtual-FIle-System

- Project Name : Customized Virtual FIle System
- Technology Used: C Programming 
- User Interface Used: Command line Interface (CUI)
- Platform Required : Windows NT or Linux Distribution
- Hardware Requirement: Intel 32 bit processor
- Description of  the Project: 
  - In this Project, implement data structures used in Operating System for FIle Management System.
  - Provide all implementations of necessary system calls and commands of File subsystem as Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM. 
  - While providing the implementations of all above functionality use my own data
structures by referring to Algorithms of UNIX operating system.
  - By using this project get the overview of UFS (UNIX File System) on any platform.

- Data Structure used in the Project: 
  - UAREA
  - FILE TABLE
  - IIT (IN CORE INODE TABLE)
  - USER FILE DESCRIPTOR TABLE
  - BOOT BLOCK
  - SUPER BLOCK
  - DILB (DATA INODE LIST BLOCK)
  - DATA BLOCK 

- To run this project use below commands
  - Open terminal / command prompt and type below command
  - `````
    g++ VFS.cpp -o myexe
   `````
  - then exexute the myexe file, if you're using windows then type myexe or using Linux distros use ./myexe
